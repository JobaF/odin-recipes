  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the
    <br />
    sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for
    <br />
    feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h4>For the meat sauce:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>0.5 medium onion</li>
    <li>0.5 large bell pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>3 ounces tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley</li>
    <li>1 tbsp italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tbsp red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>To assemble the lasagna:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>0.5 pound lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>15 oz ricotta</li>
    <li>1.5 pounds mozzarella</li>
    <li>0.25 pound grated parmesan</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <strong><li>Put pasta water on to boil</li></strong>
    <p>
      Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water)
      on
      <br />
      the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to
      <br />
      come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in
      the
      <br />
      next steps while the water is heating.
    </p>
    <strong><li>Brown the ground beef</li></strong>
    <p>
      In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add
      <br />
      the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. Remove
      <br />
      the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of
      <br />
      fat.
    </p>

    <strong>
      <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
    </strong>
    <p>
      Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using
      <br />
      yellow bell pepper and red onions). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the
      <br />
      onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and
      <br />
      cook half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir
      to
      <br />
      combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.
      <br />

    <strong>
      <li>
        Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce
        ingredients
        <br />
        to build the sauce
      </li>
    </strong>
    <p>
      Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the
      <br />
      crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. Add the
      <br />
      parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste.
      <br />
      Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. Sprinkle with
      red
      <br />
      or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting
      after
      <br />
      each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending
      on
      <br />
      how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.) Add salt to taste, and
      note
      <br />
      that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty. Bring the sauce to
      a
      <br />
      simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45
      <br />
      minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so
      <br />
      nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches. Remove from heat.

    <br />
    <strong><li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li></strong>
    <p>
      By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling.
      <br />
      Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package
      <br />
      directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.) Stir often to prevent
      <br />
      from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during
      <br />
      the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. When ready, drain in
      a
      <br />
      colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may
      <br />
      be sticking together. Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking
      <br />
      sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so
      <br />
      that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent
      them
      <br />
      from sticking together.

    <strong><li>Heat the oven to 375°F</li></strong>
    <strong><li>Assemble the lasagna</li></strong>
    <p>
      In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread
      it
      <br />
      over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles
      lengthwise
      <br />
      (about 3 long noodles, edge may overlap, depending on your pan) over the
      <br />
      sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle a
      <br />
      layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add
      half
      <br />
      of the ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches.
      <br />
      Sprinkle half the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of ricotta
      <br />
      cheese. Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining
      <br />
      sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese,
      <br />
      and another the remaining Parmesan. Finish with another layer of noodles.
      <br />
      Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with
      <br />
      the remaining Mozzarella cheese.

    <strong><li>Bake</li></strong>
    <p>
      Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't
      <br />
      touch the noodles or sauce). Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the
      <br />
      last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.
      <br />
    </p>
    <strong><li>Cool and serve</li></strong>
    <p>
      Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep
      <br />
      for about 5 days. May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave
      <br />
      aluminum tent on for storage. (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching
      <br />
      the sauce.)

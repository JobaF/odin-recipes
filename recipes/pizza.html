  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This is our ultimate oven-baked veggie lover’s pizza. Red sauce, mozzarella,
    red onions, olives, bell peppers, artichokes, and a golden crust. It’s all
    here!
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 store-bought pizza dough</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    <li>Cornmeal</li>
    <li>0.75 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup grated mozzarella</li>
    <li>0.5 yellow bell pepper</li>
    <li>0.5 small red onion</li>
    <li>0.5 cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>
    <li>1 can artichoke hearts</li>
    <li>0.25 cup parmesan</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Basil leaves</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <strong><li>Preheat the oven to 450ºF:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Set a rack about eight inches below the broiler element. If using a pizza
      <br />
      stone, set it on the rack. Preheat the oven to 450ºF for 30 minutes to get
      <br />
      the oven very hot.
    </p>
    <strong><li>Divide and shape the dough into balls:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Generously sprinkle your kitchen counter with flour. Turn the dough onto
      it.
      <br />
      Cut the dough in half. You want two pieces of dough that are each about
      one
      <br />
      pound. Each piece will make a pizza.
    </p>

    />
    <p>
      Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold all four corners of the
      <br />
      dough in towards the center. Turn the dough over and cup your hands around
      <br />
      the dough. Rotate it once or twice to form a smooth ball. If the dough is
      <br />
      very sticky, flour your hands and sprinkle the dough with a little more
      <br />
      flour. Shaping the dough into balls this way makes it easier roll them
      into
      <br />
      rounds.
    </p>

    />
    <p>
      Repeat with the second piece of dough. Cover one piece of dough with a
      <br />
      dishtowel. You will top and bake one pizza and as it cooks, you will shape
      <br />
      and top the second pizza.
    </p>

    <strong><li>Shape the dough:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Generously sprinkle your kitchen counter and the dough with flour. With
      your
      <br />
      fingertips, press the dough ball down to form an 8-inch round. Continue to
      <br />
      press and stretch the dough until it is 12 inches in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the dough springs back and is difficult to stretch, cover it with a
      <br />
      dishtowel and let it rest and relax for about 10 minutes before continuing
      <br />
      to stretch it.
    </p>

    <strong>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet:</li>
    </strong>
    <p>
      Generously sprinkle a pizza peel or a rimless baking sheet with cornmeal.
      <br />
      You will build the pizza on the peel or the baking sheet, then, if
      <br />
      transferring the pizza to a pizza stone, you will slide it off the peel
      onto
      <br />
      the stone. The cornmeal prevents sticking on either surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use your hands to transfer the stretched dough onto the peel or baking
      <br />
      sheet. If needed, stretch the dough out to make it round again.
    </p>
    <strong><li>Change the oven from baking to broiling:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Ten minutes before baking the pizza (while you assemble the topping)
      switch
      <br />
      the oven from bake to broil. Preheat the broiler. This helps the oven get
      <br />
      really, really hot. The pizza will be baked under the broiler.
    </p>
    <strong><li>Add the toppings:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Spoon half of the sauce (a little more than 1/4 cup) onto the crust and
      <br />
      spread it in an even layer using the back of the spoon. Sprinkle half of
      the
      <br />
      mozzarella (about 1/2 cup) over the sauce.
    </p>

    <p>
      Arrange half the peppers, onions, olives, and artichokes over the dough.
    </p>

    />

    <strong><li>Bake the pizza:</li></strong>
    <p>
      <strong>If using a pizza stone</strong>
      : Use a quick, jerking motion to slide the pizza off the peel onto the
      <br />
      stone. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cheese bubbles and the dough
      is
      <br />
      browned. The cook time depends on the heat of your oven, so peek
      <br />
      occasionally. Use the peel to remove the pizza from the oven and slide it
      <br />
      onto a cutting board.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If using a baking sheet</strong>
      : Place the pizza into the oven and bake for 7 to 9 minutes, or until the
      <br />
      cheese bubbles and the dough is golden. The cook time depends on the heat
      of
      <br />
      your oven, so peek occasionally. Pizza on a baking sheet will take longer
      to
      <br />
      bake than it would on a pizza stone. Remove the pan from the oven and
      slide
      <br />
      it onto a cutting board.
    </p>
    <p>Make a second pizza with the remaining dough and toppings.</p>

    />

    <strong><li>Slice and serve:</li></strong>
    <p>
      Sprinkle each pizza with Parmesan, top with the basil leaves, and drizzle
      <br />
      with olive oil. Slice and serve it warm.
